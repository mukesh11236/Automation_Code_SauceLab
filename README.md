Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the Repositorygit clone <your-repo-url> cd sauce-pom

2. Install Dependencies:
                                npm install

3. Install Playwright Browsers:
                                npx playwright install

Running Tests:
Run all tests (headless, default browser = Chromium):
                                npx playwright test

Run in headed mode:
                                npx plawright test --headed


Reports:

Reports are generated in the reports/ folder : To open the HTML report :
                                                                            npx playwright show-report reports
Screenshots & VideosScreenshots are captured on failure.
Videos are recorded only for failed tests.
Both are saved in the test-results/ folder.
Example:

test-results/
â””â”€â”€ login.test.ts-2025-09-12-12-45-00/
    â”œâ”€â”€ test-failure.png
    â””â”€â”€ video.webm

Automated Test Cases:

1. loginTest.spec.ts â€“ Valid Login:
Navigate to SauceDemo
Login with standard_user / secret_sauce
Verify landing on Products page

2. invalidLogin.spec.ts â€“ Invalid Login
Navigate to SauceDemo
Attempt login with wrong credentials
Verify error message is shown

3. addToCart.spec.ts â€“ Add Product to Cart
Login as valid user
Add a product to cart
Verify product appears in cart

4. logout.spec.ts â€“ Logout
Login as valid user
Perform logout
Verify user is redirected back to login page

Framework Highlights:
BasePage: shared actions (click, type, navigate, assertText)
POM Structure: LoginPage, ProductsPage, CartPage
Application.ts: centralized page manager â†’ no need to create page objects in every test
Reports, screenshots, videos: automatically handled via config

Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)Add fixtures for automatic Application initialization.
Add environment config files (dev, qa, prod) for baseURL & credentials.
Add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to run tests on push/PR.
